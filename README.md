Pika
=====

The snow micro-structure model, Pika, was developed following the work of 
[Kaempfer and Plapp, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.031502) and is a fully-coupled 3D finite element, 
phase field model capable of tracking the phase transition and capturing the heat and mass transfer at the 
micro-structure scale in the ice matrix and pore space.
